## Pair Trading

* Tradability testing is a two-step process consisting of evaluating the lin-
ear relationship and measuring the degree of mean reversion of the
residual.
* The linear relationship between the log-price series of the two stocks is
characterized by the cointegration coefficient and the stock premium.
* They may be estimated in a multifactor framework or by ordinary least
squares regression.
* The spread series can be calculated by applying the linear relationship.
* The degree of mean reversion of a series is quantifiable in terms of the
zero-crossing frequency.
* The zero-crossing frequency can be directly estimated using the boot-
strap procedure.
* The reciprocal of the zero-crossing frequency is indicative of the trading
period, and a pair may be deemed tradable if we are satisfied with the
range of trade periods or zero crossing frequencies generated by the
bootstrap.
